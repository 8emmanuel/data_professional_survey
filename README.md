# data_professional_survey
This is the first Power BI project I was able to complete with the help of online learning from Alex the Analyst and his YouTube tutorials.

The goal of this project is to analyze survey findings from data professional, this is real-world data. This includes:

- Importing and transforming raw data using Power Query
- Cleaning and shaping datasets
- Building data models and relationships
- Creating calculated columns and measures with DAX
- Designing an interactive and insightful Power BI dashboard

I would say that this dashboard is a bit overpopulated but it is good example of what can be done with PowerBI basics.
