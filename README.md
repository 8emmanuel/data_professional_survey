# data_professional_survey
This is the first Power BI project I was able to complete with the help of online teaching from Alex the Analyst and his YouTube tutorials. During the course I learned how to do the following:

- Importing and transforming raw data using Power Query
- Cleaning and shaping datasets
- Review data models and relationships
- Creating calculated columns and measures with DAX
- Designing an interactive and insightful Power BI dashboard

This specific project allows me to analyze survey findings from real-world data professional. I would say that this dashboard is a bit overpopulated but it is good example of what can be done with PowerBI basics. I was able to clean and transform data, split columns and create new calculated columns/measures, express findings with various visualisations and make some design refinements.
